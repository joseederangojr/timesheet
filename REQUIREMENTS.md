# Employee Management App - Timesheets SaaS

- I want 2 types of user: Admin, Employee.
- A user is allowed to be assigned in multiple roles.

-- First create database schema.
-- Create login page magic link login as default, and can toggle password based login
-- Create browser test
-- If Admin - He will be greeted as Hello, ${name}
-- If Employee - He will be greed as Hi, ${name}

- As an admin, After I login. I want to be redirected to the dashboard.


## Dashboard

Sidebar would be collapsible with app name
Sidebar Items for Admin
Dashboard - For now empty dashboard with Hello, ${name}
Timesheets - List of timesheets, you can request for change, verify timesheet, filter, sort
Users - List of users, you can filter, sort, create, edit, delete
User dropdown sticky at the bottom

Only do 1 thing at a time
Here's your flow:  Create backend logic, test, create frontend, browser test
